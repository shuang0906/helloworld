        <p>THIS YEAR MARKS the 30th anniversary of the World Wide Web, so there's been a lot
            of pixels spilled on "the initial promises of the web"—one of which was the idea that you could select
            "view source" on any
            page and easily teach yourself what went into making it display like that. <a
                href="https://glitch.com/culture/the-web-is-30-hbd/" target="_blank">Here's the very first
                webpage</a>, reproduced by the <a
                href="https://www.wired.com/story/clive-thompson-tinker-with-code">tinker-friendly</a> <a
                href="https://www.wired.com/tag/coding/">programming</a> website Glitch in honor of the anniversary,
            to point out that you can switch to the source view and see that certain parts are marked up with
        </p>
        <pre
            style="min-width: 500px"><code><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">title</span>&gt;</span>&lt;!--and--&gt;</code>

<code><span class="hljs-tag">&lt;<span class="hljs-name">p</span>&gt;</span>&lt;!--which you might be able to guess stands for "paragraph"--&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Looks pretty straightforward—but you're reading this on an English website, from the perspective
            of an English speaker.
            <br><br>
            Now, imagine that this was the first webpage you'd ever seen, that you were excited to peer under the
            hood and figure out how this worked. But instead of the labels being familiar words, you were faced with
            <a href="https://glitch.com/edit/#!/first-website-russian?path=index.html:2:11" rel="nofollow noopener"
                target="_blank">this version I created</a>, which is entirely identical to the original except that
            the source code is based on Russian rather than English. I don't speak Russian, and assuming you don't
            either, does

            In theory, you can make a programming language out of any symbols. The computer doesn't care. The
            computer is already running an invisible program (a compiler) to translate your </p>
        <blockquote><small>IF or &lt;body&gt;</small></blockquote>

        <p> into the 1s and 0s that it functions in, and it would function just as effectively if we used a potato
            emoji* to stand for </p>
        <blockquote><small>IF</small></blockquote>
        <p> and the obscure 15th century Cyrillic symbol <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiocular_O"
                rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">multiocular O</a> ꙮ to stand for </p>
        <blockquote><small>&lt;body&gt;.</small></blockquote>
        <p> The fact that programming languages often resemble English words like <i>body</i> or <i>if</i> is a
            convenient accommodation for our puny human meatbrains, which are much better at remembering commands
            that look like words we already know.
            <br><br>
            But only some of us already know the words of these commands: those of us who speak English. The
            "initial promise of the web" was only ever a promise to its English-speaking users, whether native
            English-speaking or with access to the kind of elite education that produces fluent second-language
            English speakers in non-English-dominant areas.<br>
            <br>
            It’s true that software programs and social media platforms are now often available in some 30 to 100
            languages—but what about the tools that make us creators, not just consumers, of computational tools?
            I'm not even asking whether we should make programming languages in <a
                href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-translate-wikipedia-siri-widely-spoken-languages-cant-translate/">small,
                underserved languages</a>

            (although that would be cool). Even huge languages that have extensive literary traditions and are used
            as regional trade languages, like Mandarin, Spanish, Hindi, and Arabic, still aren't widespread as
            languages of code.
