            <h2> The fact that programming languages often resemble English words like <i>body</i> or <i>if</i> is a

                It’s true that software programs and social media platforms are now often available in some 30 to 100

                showing that children who learn to code in a programming language based on their native language learn

                Adults, who are not exactly famous for how much they enjoy learning languages, have two other

                Yes, you can command your spreadsheets with formulas based on whatever language your spreadsheet
                program's interface is in. Both Excel and Google Sheets will let you write, for example,

            <h2> and the same in dozens of other languages. It's probably not the first thing you think of when you

                    target="_blank">a spreadsheet can technically be made into a Turing machine*</a>, and it does show
                that there's a business case for localized versions.<br>

                Similarly, you can edit Wikipedia and other wikis using implementations of <a

                    markup</a> based on many different languages. The basic features of Wiki markup are
                language-agnostic (such as putting square brackets [[around a link]]), but more advanced features do use
                words, and those words are in the local language. For example, if you make an infobox about a person, it
                has parameters like

                In addition to these four widely available, multilingual programming languages, there are several dozen,

                    68</a> (1960s) and <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/posts/1740/revisions"
                    rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">4th Dimension</a> (1980s). But many newer languages, like
                Python, Ruby, and Lua, come from non-English speaking countries (the Netherlands, Japan, and Brazil) and
                still use English-based keywords. The initial promise of the web is, for many people, more of a
                threat—speak English or get left out of the network.<br>
                <br>
                These languages exist because it's not difficult to translate a programming language. There are plenty
                of converters between programming languages—you can throw in a passage in JavaScript and get out the
                version in Python, or throw in a passage in Markdown and get out a version in HTML. They're not
                particularly hard to create. Programming languages have limited, well-defined vocabularies, with none of
                the ambiguity or cultural nuance that bedevils automatic machine translation of natural languages.
                Figure out the equivalents of a hundred or so commands and you can automatically map the one onto the
                other for any passage of code.<br>

                Indeed, it's so feasible to translate programming languages that people periodically do so for artistic
                or humorous purposes, a delightful type of nerdery known as <a

                begin a program with HAI and close it with KTHXBAI, and <a

                    target="_blank">Whitespace</a> is completely invisible to the human eye, made up of the invisible
                characters space, tab, and linebreak. There's even Pikachu, a programming language consisting <a

                    target="_blank">solely of the words <i>pi</i>, <i>pika</i>, and <i>pikachu</i></a> so that Pikachu
                can—very hypothetically—break away from those darn <i>Pokémon</i> trainers and get a high-paying job as
                a programmer instead.<br>
                <br>
                When you put translating code in terms of <i>Pokémon</i>, it sounds absurd. When you put translating
                code in terms of the billions of people in the world who don't speak English, access to high-paying jobs
                and the ability to tinker with your own device is no longer a hypothetical benefit. The fact that code
                depends on English blocks people from this benefit, for reasons that are entirely unnecessary at a
                technical level.

            <h2>But a programming language isn't just its technical implementation—it's also a human community. The four
                widespread multilingual programming languages have had better luck so far with fostering that community
                than the solitary non-English-based programming languages, but it's still a critical bottleneck. You
                need to find useful resources when you Google your error messages. Heck, you need to figure out how to
                get the language up and running on your computer at all. That's why it was so important that the first
                web browser let you edit—not just view—websites, why Glitch has made such a point of letting you edit
                working code from inside a browser window and making it easy to ask for help. But where's the Glitch for
                the non-English-speaking world? How do we make the web as tinker-friendly for the people who are joining
                it now (or who have been using it as a consumer for the past decade) as it was for its earliest
                arrivals?<br>

                Here's why I still have hope. In medieval Europe, if you wanted to access the technology of writing, you
                had to acquire a new language at the same time. Writing meant Latin. Writing in the vernacular—in the
                mother tongues, in languages that people already spoke—was an obscure, marginalized sideline. Why would
                you even want to learn to write in English or French? There's nothing to read there, whereas Latin got
                you access to the intellectual tradition of an entire lingua franca.<br>
                <br>
                We have a tendency to look back at this historical era and wonder why people bothered with all that
                Latin when they could have just written in the language they already spoke. At the time, learning Latin
                in order to learn how to write was as logical as learning English in order to code is today, even though
                we now know that <a
                    href="https://www.economist.com/leaders/2019/02/23/the-perils-of-learning-in-english"
                    rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">children learn to read much faster</a> if they're taught in
                their mother tongue first. The arguments for English-based code that I see on websites like Stack
                Overflow are much the same: Why not just learn English? It gains you access to an entire technological
                tradition.<br>
                <br>
                We know that Latin's dominance in writing ended. The technology of writing spread to other languages.
                The technology of coding is no more intrinsically bound to English than the technology of writing was
                bound to Latin. I propose we start by adjusting the way we talk about programming languages when they
                contain words from human languages. The first website wasn't written in HTML—it was written in
                <i>English</i> HTML. The snippet of code that appears along the bottom of <a
                    href="https://glitch.com/culture/the-web-is-30-hbd/" rel="nofollow noopener"
                    target="_blank">Glitch's reproduction</a>? It's not in JavaScript, it's in <i>English</i>
                JavaScript. When we name the English default, it becomes more obvious that we can question it—we can
                start imagining a world that also contains Russian HTML or Swahili JavaScript, where you don't have an
                unearned advantage in learning to code if your native language happens to be English.<br>
                <br>
                This world doesn't exist yet. Perhaps in the next 30 years, we'll make it.
